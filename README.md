# LaTeX

I own some old school HP programmable calculators like the HP-11C, HP-15C, HP-16C and HP-41C.

I wanted to document some programs written for those little machines so I wrote some helpful LaTeX libraries.
These can be found in the HP_RPN directory.

That directory also contains some sample code. 
The most recent one is a little program to solve Problem 1 from the Project Euler.

Share and enjoy!
